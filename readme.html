Zik Multimedia Library : Readme

Zik Multimedia Library
Description
The Zik library provides basic easy to use multimedia functionality for games.
Building
Zik uses CMake for it's build system.  To generate build files, create a directory, navigate to it and enter this command:
cmake <source directory>
where <source directory> is the directory with CMakeLists.txt.

Installation

Installation can be achieved by building the INSTALL project that CMake creates, or with make install (I think.  I don't use make, so I wouldn't know.)
